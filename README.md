# Tikki #

Tikki is the application for collection and management of field aptitude 
perfomance data of Finnish reservists. Key features are easy and fast result 
recording and controlled authorization of results. The development of the 
app is managed by Lis채채 liikett채 program, led by the Finnish Reservist 
Sports Federation (RESUL).

## Organisation ##

Tikki is an open source project managed by the Reservil채isurheiluliitto Ry
(RESUL). https://resul.fi/

## Developer's guide ##

Below are instructions for initializing and operating the development environment.

### Initializing development environment ###

We recomment using pipenv for managing a virtualenv, which can be installed as follows:

```bash
pip install pipenv
pipenv --install --three -r requirements.txt
```

### Bumping dependencies ###

`requirements.txt` is dynamically generated with pinned versions using pip-compile from 
`setup.py` and `requirements-dev.in`, tha latter which contains dependencies only needed 
for developent. It is recommended to regenerate requirements every once in a while with
the following command:

```bash
pip-compile -U --output-file requirements.txt setup.py requirements-dev.in
```

This overwrites the old version of `requirements.txt` with the most recent pinned
versions of all dependencies.
